## 1.10
Programming errors in java can be categorized into three forms:
1. Syntax errors: These are errors recognized by the compiler, they are usually caused by mistakes in syntax
2. Runtime errors: These are errors that cause the program to terminate abnormally, usually occurs when the environment the program is running in encounters and operation that is impossible to carry out.
3. Logic errors: This are errors that occur due to programs not behaving the way they are intended to.

## Ending summary
1. every java class must have a main method, without this an error will be thrown
2. the name of a class file must the the same as the name of the class itself 
3. Java is case-sensitive
