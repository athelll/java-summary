in Java the statement for printing is simply:
```java
System.out.println("arbitrary text");
```

## Program Boilerplate
In Java some boilerplate is required to tell Java the name of our program. This name must also be the same as the name of the file that contains the program.

an example below is example.java:
```java
public class Example {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.printlin)("This is an example");
	}
}
```

## How Java projects run
1. Firstly program is compiled into java bytecode
2. This is done by the Java Compiler
3. Then the bytecode is executed in a one-by-one fashion by the java interpreter

To print multiple lines—use multiple println statements. doi!

## Ending Notes
1. parameters are data passed into a function to perform a specific task relating to the parameter itself. Example is passing strings into the println function in-between its parentheses, also *Extra Note—parameters are usually passed into parentheses of functions* 
2. Semicolons separate commands in java.
3. comments are un-executed pieces of texts in source codes—its used to write notes, disable parts of codes, or document things related to the code or the part of the code where they are documented beside.
