a conditional statement is a statement that is dependent on the result of a boolean expression to determine its course of execution.

## If statements
they are done in java via:
```java
if (conditional_is_true) {
	// execute this
} 
```

## if else statements
this are done in java via:
```java
if (conditional_is_true) {
	// run this
} else {
	// run this instead
}
```

## else if statements
they are done in java via:
```java
if (condtion) {
	// run this
} else if (another_condition) {
	// or this
} else {
	// or this
}
```

## Conditional statement expression and the boolean variable
the value that goes between the parentheses of a conditional statement should be of boolean type after the evaluation

booleans are also returned when used in a boolean statement outside of a conditional statement, therefore we can do this:
```java
boolean is_5_larger_than_4 = 5 > 4;
```
the above expression should return true to the variable

## Conditional statements and comparing Strings
we can compare the equality of number based variables using the equality operator `==`but we cant do the same with strings. According to what i read—its possible for variable like integers and such because they can hold a sort of finite amount of data and Strings do not work in that fashion (according to them string can hold a limitless amount of characters and integers and such only hold a single value).

so when comparing strings we use the `equals` method with String objects posses.
```java
String input = "a string";

if (input.equals("a string"))
	System.out.println("Yes they contain the same content")
```
