input refers to string written by the user and read by the program. For reading input we use the Scanner tool that comes with java.

The scanner tool is imported via:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```
The tool itself is created as an object via:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
## `nextLine()` Method
The input is read via the scanner method`nextLine()`. The nextLine method awaits the  user to enter a string and then assigns the string to the string variable it returns to.

example program that awaits input from user and prints it:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Input String: ");
		String message = scanner.nextLine();
		System.out.println(message);
	}
}
```

## Fundamental of Strings
Strings are declared via:
```java
String message = "Hello World!";
```
Strings enclosed in a quotation marks are known as `string literals`â€”A string with a specified value.

## Concatenation
a string can be concatenated in java using the + operator. An example.
```java
System.out.println("Hello " + "Finn!");
```
the same method can also be used to concatenate a string variable and a string literal.
